    Strategies and renderers consume public text and tool-call views; they must
    not reconstruct signed thinking or know the gateway's extension fields.
    Capture therefore stores reasoning, answer text, and calls as ordered parts,
    with each signature or encrypted item attached to its owning part. Chat's
    normalized response already groups these fields; we preserve that ordering,
    not an interleaving the transport has discarded. Readable reasoning is kept
    once even when LiteLLM exposes it both as a block and reasoning_content.

    Public fields are moved out of detached native containers before the parts
    freeze them. Unknown routes and incomplete native sequences keep portable
    text but lose native state together; malformed supported shapes raise rather
    than turning a successful-looking capture into silently incomplete replay.
